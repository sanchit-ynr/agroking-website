## AI Working Rules (Must Follow)

1. Before making any code change, read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
2. After completing any task that changes:
   - architecture
   - deployment
   - constraints
   - major components
   update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
3. If no architectural change occurred, do NOT update the file.
4. Never introduce server-side features unless explicitly approved.
